  <h2
    >Is Nostr a Bitcoin thing?
  </h2>
  <p>
   No. While Bitcoin can and has been integrated with Nostr, Nostr is an 
   independent communications protocol. No use or understanding of Bitcoin
   is required to participate.
  </p>

  <h2>
    How can I see my friend's notes if I post on a specific relays and my friend
    on others?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Different approaches can be used, but the most common one is that your
    client will automatically announce the relays you generally publish to, and
    your friend's client will automatically connect to these relays specifically
    to fetch your notes (and connect to other relays to fetch other people's
    notes).
  </p>

  <h2>
    How can Nostr deal with horrible people without moderation (or some form of
    good censorship)?
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are any methods of moderation available to limit what you see. Relays 
    are privately owned and can remove content as the owner sees fit. As the  
    network grows, it will become more common for relays to have stated rules  
    and sign up processes that limit what can be published and by whom.  It is  
    your choice which relays to use that align with your worldview and interests.
    You are in control. Clients can also help protect you from harrassment and  
    spam by fetching only the notes you request and filtering out junk. The 
    option to mute other users is also available in most clients.
  </p>
 
  <h2>
    How can Nostr stay decentralized if the amount of content relays have to
    store keeps getting bigger and so relays get increasingly costlier to run?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Relays do not need to store everything forever and often don't.  Different
    relays can be large, small, long term, short term, or whatever its owner
    decides is best. You can even run your own. 
  </p>

  <h2>
    How do I find more relays?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Ask your friends, check other people's relay lists, or use one of the relay
    explorers that are available.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Should I connect to a lot of relays?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Too many relays can bog down your client and ruin your experience. Not enough
    relays can leave you in the dark. Try adding and removing a few until you 
    find what works best for you. Give your clients a little time to connect
    after each addition or removal, they need time to talk to eachother.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Can my data be lost if a relay shuts down?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Yes, but if you are connected to more than one reliable relay it should not
    be an issue. If you are concerned about this happening, consider using a paid
    relay or hosting your own.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why can't I follow as many people as I want?
  </h2>
  <p>
    You CAN follow as many people as you want, but if that number is very large,
    your experience may be degraded. Because there is no central server, data is
    pulled from many different places. Requesting a lot of data can slow that
    process down, but don't worry. You can follow A LOT of people before that
    becomes a concern.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why can't I read every note thats ever been posted publicly?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Relays can get rid of old stuff to make room for new stuff. You should be
    able to find many old notes on relays that specialize in long term storage.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Is the Global, Universe, or Plaza feed actually global?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Not really. Each client has a set of relays that it uses to fill these feeds
    at random. Many allow you to change them too.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why are replies and reactions different on different clients?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Each client has its own method for gathering this information. Different
    relays handle this information in different ways as well. As the network 
    grows, this should become more stable across clients.
  </p>

  <h2>
    How do I find my friends?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Ask for their npub or Nostr address, then you can search to find them.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why is my follower count different all the time?
  </h2>
  <p>
    A follow is an action taken by someone else. That information is stored 
    with their data, just as who you follow is stored with your data.
    Each client and relay handles this differently so you may see 
    inconsistencies across clients.
  </p>

  <h2>
    How can I find topics I enjoy?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The network is still very new and topic discovery is constantly growing.
    Hashtag searches are currently very popular. You can even follow hashtags
    in some clients. Other methods such as AI-powered data vending machines, 
    search relays, and curated lists exist too. Once you learn more about 
    what Nostr has to offer, you will find which method works best for you.
  </p>

  <h2>
    I messed up. How can I delete my note?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Some clients offer a "request deletion" feature. Ultimately, it is up to
    relays to honor your request. If you are concerned about deletion, check 
    with your relay operators and use a client that offers the feature. There
    is no guarantee that it will be fully deleted from every relay.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Can I make my profile private?
  </h2>
  <p>
    No, most activity on Nostr is public unless it is handled only by 
    specialized, private relays.
  </p>

  <h2>
    How can I recover my account if I lose my private key/nsec?
  </h2>
  <p>
    You can't. Keep it safe and secure. Keep a backup copy. Only enter it in
    clients/extensions/key-keepers that you trust.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why can't i reset my private key/nsec?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Each key is linked to the unique identity, or npub, when it is created.
    Because there is no central authority to issue this to you, you are fully
    responsible for keeping your identity safe.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Who is in charge of Nostr?
  </h2>
  <p>
    No one. Nostr was designed to allow you to use many different apps and clients
    for all sorts of stuff, with just one identity. Cool, right? With no central
    authority to communicate through, you're in charge of what you see, read,
    watch, and do.
  </p>

  <h2>
    How is Nostr different than other decentralized protocols?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Most other protocols are dependent on small servers to store your data.
    Nostr's relays are similar, but even smaller and there are many. More are
    joining the network all the time. Your data is written to many relays in
    many places. This ensures that your data is still out there somewhere, in
    the event that a relay shuts down or if someone is trying to censor you.
    You can always run your own relay too!
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why should I use Nostr instead of _______?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Nostr puts you in control of what you see and interact with in an online
    social setting. Additionally, no one can "cancel" you, yours friends, or
    anyone else. The social part is only the base layer of a growing
    ecosystem of different games, productivity tools, and all sorts of other 
    stuff. Give it a try!
